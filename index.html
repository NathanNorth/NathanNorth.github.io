            Spycam is <a href="https://spycambot.net/">a Discord bot</a> that uses <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J">my wrapper of Riot Game’s REST api</a> to synthesize data from VALORANT (a competitive first person shooter) and distribute that data to a new endpoint. For example, one of the core features is viewing a simplified match history breakdown in a Discord embed.
            <br>
            As the sole person behind this project I have prototyped the product, pitched/communicated with Riot Games for production API access, designed the server backend, and implemented all code.

            Chess3 is an original networked multiplayer turn-based strategy game built in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> with C#. Chess3 is a collaborative effort that is seeing active development. I manage the project and serve as our lead engineer. Four other friends help with tasks from design to art to coding, interacting with the APIs that I designed.            <br>
            This was a great exercise in API design, and a chance to let other people interact with my code. Setting up (and teaching my friends how to use) source control for this was great practice for working in a team.

            The <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/vc-notification-bot">vc-notification-bot</a> is a dead simple tool to help keep track of when people join voice channels in Discord using the Slash Commands API. The bot is built reactively using <a href="https://discord4j.com/">Discord4J</a> and a <a href="https://r2dbc.io/">R2BDC</a> managed PostgreSQL database backend. The project is currently at a beta release of version 1.2
            <br>
            This sort of project is really rewarding because it's a tool that fits my needs. My friends and I use it every day. PostgreSQL (and my associated docker container) took forever to debug, but I’m really happy that I ended up with a final project that was performant and scalable.

            <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/Riot4J">Riot4J</a> is a work-in-progress reactive Java wrapper for the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games API</a> with a specific focus on the VALORANT APIs. Riot4J is built with <a href="https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty">Project Reactor's Netty</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson">Immutable Jackson Objects</a>.
            <br>
            Riot4J is perhaps the best code I’ve written structurally. I took a very modular approach to design and it’s paid massive dividends as a result. I stepped away from this project for a month or so, and when I came back to add some new APIs it was amazingly easy thanks to that modular structure.

        <div class="aSlide" style="position:relative;">
            The AI bot is a Discord bot built using fine-tuned <a href="https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/">GPT-2 models</a> and <a href="https://discord4j.com/">Discord4J</a> to create AI conversations trained on messages sent in Discord servers.
            <br>
            In creating this project I learned how to make my first Discord Bot reactively with the help of a friend and the Discord4J support community. I also learned how to use an SQLite database to store basic user information. AI generation requires a large computational load, and so I built a priority queuing system for high impact processes.

            I maintain <a href="https://github.com/NathanNorth/botw-freecam">a fork</a> of <a href="https://github.com/etra0/botw-freecam">etra0 - ‘s fantastic custom camera for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. I learned a little bit of rust to take the core tools that he built, and adapt them to better serve my needs.
            <br>
            As a cinematographer, when I discovered etra0’s work I was astounded by what he had accomplished. His core tool was fantastic, but lacked dealbreaker features for me like editing paths and saving system state. I knew literally nothing about rust, but dove in and was able to add the features that I wanted out of this tool so that I could use it to create the sort of videos I wanted to.
